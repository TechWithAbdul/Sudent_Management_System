# Student Management System (SMS)

## Overview
The Student Management System (SMS) is a C++ console-based, menu-driven application designed to manage student records. It leverages **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** concepts for efficient record management.

## Features
- **Admin Authentication**: Secure login with a default admin username and password.
- **Student Record Management**:
  - Add, update, delete, and search student records.
  - Display all student records.
  - Sort student records by GPA using linked list traversal and swapping.
  - Count the total number of student records.
- **Menu-Based Interaction**: User-friendly interface for smooth navigation.
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Records are saved and loaded from a file (`studentsRECORD.txt`).
- **DSA Concepts**: Utilizes stacks,queue,sorting and linked lists for dynamic record handling.
- **OOP Principles**: Implements classes like `Admin` and `Student` for modular design.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Data Structures**: stack,sorting,queue and Linked lists for record management.
- **OOP Concepts**: Classes, objects, and encapsulation.
- **File Handling**: For persistent data storage.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
2. Open the project in a C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or Code::Blocks).
3. Compile and run the sms.cpp file.
4. Use the default admin credentials:
     Username: dsa
     Password: 1122
5.Follow the menu options to interact with the system.
**File Structure**
1. sms.cpp: Main application file implementing the system.
2. studentsRECORD.txt: Data file for storing and loading student records.
